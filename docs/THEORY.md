## Emergent Gravity from Quantum Field Theory

This document outlines the theoretical foundation for extracting emergent gravitational coupling from quantum field theory via holographic duality.

### Core Concept

The central idea is that classical gravity can emerge from quantum field theory through the holographic principle. Local gravitational interactions arise from entanglement structure in the quantum field configuration.

### Mathematical Framework

#### 1. Local Projectors

Local projectors $\Pi_x$ are constructed at each lattice site $x$ using Fourier-localization:

```
π_x = ∫ d^d k φ(k) e^{ik·x} |k⟩⟨k|
```

Where:
- $φ(k)$ is a localization function (typically Gaussian)
- $|k⟩$ are momentum eigenstates
- The integration is over the Brillouin zone

#### 2. Commutator Metric

The fundamental distance measure between sites is the commutator metric:

```
d²(i,j) = Tr([Π_i, Π_j]†[Π_i, Π_j])
```

This quantifies the "quantum distance" between lattice sites based on their operator commutation relations.

#### 3. Entanglement Entropy

For a spatial region A, the entanglement entropy is:

```
S(A) = -Tr(ρ_A log ρ_A)
```

Where $ρ_A$ is the reduced density matrix for region A.

### Emergent Gravity Extraction

#### Protocol A: Surface Minimization

1. **Region Construction**: Partition the lattice into regions A and B
2. **Surface Detection**: Find the minimal surface separating A and B using min-cut algorithms
3. **Entropy Calculation**: Compute entanglement entropy across the surface
4. **G_eff Extraction**: Use the area law scaling:
   ```
   S(A) ∝ Area(∂A) / (4G_eff)
   ```

#### Protocol B: Mass-Defect Analysis

1. **Baseline State**: Compute metric distances in unperturbed state
2. **Mass Perturbation**: Apply small mass-defect $μ$ to central region
3. **Response Measurement**: Measure change in metric: $h_{00}(r) = d²_{pert}(r) - d²_{base}(r)$
4. **κ Fitting**: Fit response to $h_{00}(r) = -2κ/r$
5. **Linearity Test**: Verify $κ ∝ μ$ to validate response

### Key Requirements

#### Locality Preservation

The projector construction must preserve spatial locality:
- Nearby sites should have stronger coupling than distant ones
- Link weights should decay with distance: $w(r) ∝ r^{-α}$ with $α > 0$

#### Deterministic Construction

To ensure locality, projectors use deterministic rank-1 construction:
```
P = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|
```
Where $|ψ⟩$ comes directly from Fourier weights, avoiding random matrix steps that destroy locality.

#### Finite-Size Effects

For finite lattices, extrapolation to infinite size is needed:
```
G_eff(n) = G_∞ + A/n
```
Where $n$ is the lattice size and $A$ is a finite-size correction.

### Validation Tests

#### 1. Flat Space Test

In flat space, the metric should satisfy exact scaling:
```
d²(i,j) = (i-j)²
```

This is achieved using Pauli matrix construction without artificial tuning.

#### 2. Edge-Radius Sensitivity

Changes in connectivity radius should produce controlled effects:
- Extending from $r_C = 1$ to $r_C = 4$ should capture 95% of surface weight
- Sensitivity should be ≤ 5% for converged results

#### 3. Protocol Consistency

Both Protocol A and Protocol B should yield consistent $G_{eff}$ values within theoretical uncertainties.

### Physical Interpretation

#### Units and Scales

The emergent gravitational coupling has dimensions:
```
[G_eff] = Length²
```

Converting to physical units requires:
```
G_SI = G_eff × a² × c² / ℓ₀²
```

Where:
- $a$ is the lattice spacing
- $c$ is the speed of light  
- $ℓ₀$ is a characteristic length scale
- $λ$ is a dimensionless coupling parameter

#### Holographic Interpretation

The emergence of gravity follows the holographic principle:
- Bulk gravitational dynamics encoded in boundary quantum field theory
- Entanglement structure determines geometric properties
- Classical gravity emerges in the appropriate limit
