# Core scientific computing - REQUIRED
numpy>=1.21.0
scipy>=1.7.0

# Parallel processing - REQUIRED for corrected algorithm
joblib>=1.0.0

# Visualization - OPTIONAL
matplotlib>=3.4.0

# Development and testing - OPTIONAL
pytest>=6.0.0

# REMOVED: networkx (corrected algorithm uses direct geometric approach)
# REMOVED: pandas (not needed for core physics)
# REMOVED: seaborn (optional visualization only)
# REMOVED: sphinx (documentation tools)

# Note: Corrected Ryu-Takayanagi algorithm uses pure geometric surface minimization
# without NetworkX graph algorithms, following strict physics compliance
